/*
AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
Use XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects to interact with servers

AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:
Update a web page without reloading the page
Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
Send data to a server - in the background
